# RandomPasswordGenerator
This Python script generates a random password based on the user's desired password length. It utilizes **list comprehension** to create a password by randomly selecting characters from a combination of **letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation symbols**.

## Features:
- **Customizable Password Length**: The user can specify the desired password length.
- **Random Character Selection**: The password is generated by randomly selecting characters from a mix of letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Secure Password Generation**: The script creates a strong, unpredictable password with a variety of character types.

## How It Works:
1. The user is prompted to input their desired password length.
2. A character set is defined, which includes all ASCII letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation characters.
3. The script uses **list comprehension** to iterate for the desired number of characters, selecting one random character from the predefined set each time.
4. The **`random.choice()`** function picks characters randomly, and **`join()`** concatenates them into the final password.
5. The generated password is then displayed to the user.
